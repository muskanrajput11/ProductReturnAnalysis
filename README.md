#  Product Return Pattern Analysis for E-Commerce

A complete end-to-end Data Analyst + Machine Learning project to analyze and predict product return behavior in an e-commerce setting using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn.

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical product return data to understand key return patterns and predict the probability of a product being returned using machine learning.

### Problem Statement
In the e-commerce industry, product returns directly impact customer satisfaction, logistics costs, and seller reputation. By understanding return patterns, we can:
- Reduce return rates
- Identify high-risk categories or users
- Take proactive measures in UI, packaging, or logistics

##  Dashboard Preview

An interactive web dashboard built using **Streamlit + Plotly** that allows:
- Filtering return trends by **category & date**
- Viewing **monthly return rates**
- Predicting return **likelihood** based on product/user inputs
- Downloading reports and prediction history
